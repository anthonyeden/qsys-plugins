# Network Monitoring Plugins

*Note: Link Monitor has moved into a subdirectory.*

Locimation has developed two plugins for extracting useful network infrastructure information from network devices via SNMP:

### Link Monitor

This is a control plugin that enables Q-Sys to monitor the reachability and operational link state of network devices (such as switches and routers) that make use if the IF-MIB and SNMP v2c

### MAC Address Monitor

This is a control plugin that enables Q-Sys to monitor the MAC address table of a device (typically, a network switch) in order to see which port a specified MAC address is reachable on.
